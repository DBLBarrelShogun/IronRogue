IronRogue is a fork of the original Pok√©Rogue fangame which aims to provide the tools required to more easily automate the process of running Pok√©Rogue IronMon. The original IronRogue rules can be found at https://github.com/Reimittv/IronRogue/tree/main.

## Warnings
Although every effort is made to ensure this fork honours changes made to the original <strong>Running this fork may lead to unexpected corruption of your Pok√©Rogue data,</strong> as such it is recommended that you run it within an incognito session that is not logged into your main account. If you wish to load your Pok√©Rogue into IronRogue this can be done by first exporting your data to <picture><img src="./public/images/export_data.png" width="300" alt="Export Data"></picture> a .prsv file and importing this back into IronRogue.

Pok√©Rogue is a browser based Pok√©mon fangame heavily inspired by the roguelite genre. Battle endlessly while gathering stacking items, exploring many different biomes, fighting trainers, bosses, and more!
